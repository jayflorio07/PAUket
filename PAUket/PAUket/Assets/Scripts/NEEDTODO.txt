// implement calculation for speed and heading from azimuth, correction of
  azimuth, and distance calculation (vector!)
(first from mocker (probably using the tempPlayerController))
real location probably controls the tPC to make it smooth. 


icon scaling for OTHER icons (fixed (events/labels) and mobile (users))

making sure another users icon scaling does NOT affect your own.



altimeter readings (corrected as reference ONLY!) to determine floor 
(altimeter resets when walking/moving outside)


// TECHNICAL (USER)

fix date capture issue for Event.cs
When a user clicks on event, camera should move to the event and the
UI should display the eventname/time etc... (REMINDER, YOU CANNOT SIGNUP/JOIN
EVENTS USING PAUket (yet???) It will simply allow you to see what is going on
and may provide navigation to the event. 

click and drag map (disable minimap script from player temporarily)
(add button to revert operation)

// OTHER/MISC.

Make NORTH BUG move in rectangle around the view area. 


DEVELOP UI and "Search Bar"
Enable searching for locations...by labelling said locations (and then 
displaying their names)


Probably have to make prefabs for events and "entities" to reuse as needed.

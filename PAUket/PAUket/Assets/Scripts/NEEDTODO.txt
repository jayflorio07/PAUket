// implement calculation for speed and heading from azimuth, correction of
  azimuth, and distance calculation (vector!)
(first from mocker (probably using the tempPlayerController))
real location probably controls the tPC to make it smooth. 
    // DONE

icon scaling for OTHER icons (fixed (events/labels) and mobile (users))
    // DONE

making sure another users icon scaling does NOT affect your own.
    // OTHER USERS???? (DELAYED)


altimeter readings (corrected as reference ONLY!) to determine floor 
(altimeter resets when walking/moving outside)
    // ALTIMETER FUNCTION (DELAYED)

// TECHNICAL (USER)

fix date capture issue for Event.cs
When a user clicks on event, camera should move to the event and the
UI should display the eventname/time etc... (REMINDER, YOU CANNOT SIGNUP/JOIN
EVENTS USING PAUket (yet???) It will simply allow you to see what is going on
and may provide navigation to the event. 

click and drag map (disable minimap script from player temporarily)
(add button to revert operation)

// OTHER/MISC.

Make NORTH BUG move in rectangle around the view area.
    // CANCELLED, REPLACED WITH ROTATING COMPASS IN TOP LEFT. 


DEVELOP UI and "Search Bar"
Enable searching for locations...by labelling said locations (and then 
displaying their names)
    // IN PROGRESS (21:50, 2021/11/30)
add dictionary (for lookup) and sorting alg.
    // DELAYED (CRITICAL)

Probably have to make prefabs for events and "entities" to reuse as needed.

Actual navigation (vectors and best route calculation). 
    // IN PROGRESS (EARLY STAGE)
    // will do based on intersections and checkpoints. (MC2 style)

Indoor maps (I NEED BETTER PICTURES TO GENERATE VECTORS!)
    // IN PROGRESS (CRITICAL)
    // a dummy map from the fire escape plan is given for swirbul library.

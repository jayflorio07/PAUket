# PAUket
PAUket application:

This branch serves to hold our mobile application/web application for the PAUket application. 
The PAUket application has a website that may be accessed through Adelphi University's E-campus. The website is also fully mobile responsive so it also serves as PAUket's mobile application.
This website includes features such as a log in page to access E campus credentials, a section including a button that will launch the navigation app, campus life information such as events,
location services, find a friend features, and public safety features.
